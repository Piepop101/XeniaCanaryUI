This is a portable, lightweight UI for Xenia Canary that displays Zar files. The application automatically adds any .Zar in the XeniaCanaryUI/games folder.
The application will ONLY work if you put it in the same location as your xenia_canary.exe and create a "games" folder in that location as well. 
You can add your own square icons to each game by dropping the icon onto the game name. If you want to remove the icon, right click "Remove Icon".
Icons are stored in the "icons" folder.
