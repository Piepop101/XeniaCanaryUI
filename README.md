This is a portable, lightweight UI for Xenia Canary that displays .zar files. The application works by adding any .zar file from your "XeniaCanary/games" folder to the UI, where you can drag and drop custom square images as thumbnails for your games. You **MUST** create the "games" folder in the same location as the "xenia_canary.exe" for the .zar files to get detected. Any game can be run by double-clicking it or by right-clicking and selecting "Run Application". Right-clicking and selecting "Remove Icon" will permanently remove the current icon. Icons are stored in the "icons" folder and automatically renamed when added to a game. The path to each icon is loaded from the icon_mappings.txt file. There are also settings to customize "Icon Size", "Window Size", and "Start Fullscreen", which are saved to the XeniaCanaryUISettings.txt file. All .txt files can be edited independently of the application.
